Hello again, let's dive into Thinky's LCU install process today.

This will help you easily execute the LCU packages you build or find from the community.

Click into the LCU install menu and enter the name of the package to install.

I'm using the at fathym it lcu arcade package for this demo.

When prompted, select yes to confirm you want to install the package.

This will lead to the first prompt, where we can select to create a new project.

Select a GitHub organization to fork the arcade home page into, allowing you to make edits if you'd like.

Once the organization is selected, Thinky will run through all the phases of the LCU package, and keep you informed as to what she is doing.

Now we can confirm the LCU is installed correctly by listing our EaC projects.

Clicking on the preview link will open the arcade home page, where you can select a game to play.

The game opens on a separate route than the home page.

This might make you think the apps all live together in a single codebase.

Instead, we are leveraging the Fathym runtime's composable application architecture to leverage multiple disparate codebases.

Jumping into the Fathym dashboard, we can see that there are 6 different route configurations, each using a different codebase for its deployment package.

The home page leverages a GitHub deployment package, you can see the new forked repo in your organization.

Back in the dashboard you can switch over to one of the games, like Astray, and see that they are deployed from NPM packages.

Check out the packages at npm j s dot com.

Thanks for taking the time to see how Thinky can help you install LCU packages. Happy LCUing.
