Welcome back, we are going to keep looking at some of Thinky's features.

We'll be looking at the Open Chats feature which gives you A GPT chat session that keeps your enterprise data yours.

You can click through using the buttons or simply type what you are looking for.

Once a new chat is started, you'll be able to name it and recall the history.

We'll start a little react based dev chat with Thinky, to organize any questions we have around React.

Type in your question or statement, or even choose to start by letting Thinky know who she should behave as.

Thinky will respond with her best answer.

To keep our chats organized we can rename it, you can also have thinky name it.

After renaming, you can continue the conversation as needed.  Dive into any topics you want, even beyond development and product conversations.

To change chats, simply type, change chat.

You can continue chats by pressing continue and then selecting the chat from the list.

After continuing the chat you can recall the history to see where you left off .

Easily switch between chats to keep your conversations organized.

Another easy way to get caught up on your chats is to simply ask Thinky to summarize it.
